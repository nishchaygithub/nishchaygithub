# 👋 Hello, I'm Nishchay!

🎓** I'm a student** at **CDGI Indore**, currently focusing on learning C and C++ programming languages. I'm passionate about coding and enjoy exploring various concepts and techniques.

🎯 In my free time, you can find me pursuing my other passion: shooting. I specialize in the 10-meter air rifle discipline and find it to be a great way to unwind and challenge myself outside of coding.

💼 As a student, I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and honing my skills in the field of programming. I'm excited to explore opportunities that combine my love for coding with my interest in shooting.

🌟 My goal is to become a proficient software developer and contribute to innovative projects that make a positive impact. I'm particularly interested in [mention any specific areas or technologies you're interested in].

# 📫 Feel free to reach out to me via :

I'm always open to connecting with fellow programmers,developers and enthusiasts.
